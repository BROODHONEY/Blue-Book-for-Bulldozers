# Blue-Book-for-Bulldozers

This is my model for a kaggle contest,<i> Ben Hamner, Fast Iron 2, and FastIron. Blue Book for Bulldozers. https://kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers, 2013. Kaggle. </i> hosted on jan 25, 2013 which solves a regression type problem. 

## Description
The goal of the contest is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equiment at auction based on it's usage, equipment type, and configuaration.  The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.

Fast Iron is creating a "blue book for bull dozers," for customers to value what their heavy equipment fleet is worth at auction.

## Evaluation 
The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

## Leaderboard position 

<i> Note: This project is not in the competition! </i>

When compared with the leaderboard, this model stands at 26th position with a RMSLE value of `0.2438688551772499`.
