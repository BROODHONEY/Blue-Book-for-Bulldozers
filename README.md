# Blue-Book-for-Bulldozers

This is my model for a kaggle contest,<i> Ben Hamner, Fast Iron 2, and FastIron. Blue Book for Bulldozers. https://kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers, 2013. Kaggle. </i> hosted on jan 25, 2013 which solves a regression type problem. 

<b> Description :</b> </br>
The goal of the contest is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equiment at auction based on it's usage, equipment type, and configuaration.  The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.

Fast Iron is creating a "blue book for bull dozers," for customers to value what their heavy equipment fleet is worth at auction.

<b> Evaluation :</b> </br>
The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.
